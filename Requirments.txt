Project 5 - Hotel Reservation and Guest Services Management System
SkyNest Hotels is a regional hotel chain operating in Sri Lanka, offering accommodation
and premium services in its branches located in Colombo, Kandy, and Galle. The
management has been using an outdated desktop-based system for bookings and
service tracking, which has led to frequent overbookings, billing delays, and manual
errors.
To modernise operations, SkyNest has decided to implement a unified Hotel
Reservation and Guest Services Management System (HRGSMS). Your team is hired
to design the backend database that supports hotel room bookings, guest check-
ins/check-outs, service tracking, and billing. A UI is required for the system, but the
primary focus is on database correctness, consistency, and report generation.
The system must support the following features:
•Each hotel branch consists of a number of rooms, categorised by room type (e.g.,
Single, Double, Suite). Room types differ by capacity, daily rate, and amenities.
•A guest can make a room booking for a given check-in and check-out period.
Each booking includes room details, guest information, payment method, and
booking status (Booked, Checked-In, Checked-Out, Cancelled).
•The system must prevent double-booking of the same room during overlapping
periods.
•At the time of check-in, the system must update the room status to Occupied,
and once the guest checks out, it must be updated to Available.
•During their stay, guests can request chargeable services, such as room service,
spa treatments, laundry, or minibar usage. These services are stored in a service
catalogue and linked to the respective booking.
•Each service usage entry includes service name, date, quantity, and price at the
time of usage.
•At checkout, the system must calculate the final bill, which includes:
oRoom charges (based on room rate × number of nights)
oService charges (sum of all services used during the stay)
•The total bill must be paid before the booking is marked as Checked-Out.
•Guests can make partial payments, but the system must flag bookings with
outstanding dues.
The management requires the following reports from the system:1. Room occupancy report for a selected date or period
2. Guest billing summary, including unpaid balances
3. Service usage breakdown per room and service type
4. Monthly revenue per branch (from room charges and services)
5. Top-used services and customer preference trends
Task
Your task is to model the database design to encapsulate these requirements. It should
consider all entities and relationships given in the description. Moreover, you must
identify where procedures, functions, and triggers are required to ensure ACID
compliance. Foreign keys and primary keys must be defined for referential integrity.
Appropriate indexing must be applied to improve performance in frequent queries.
Additionally, review materials related to hotel operations and make assumptions where
necessary (e.g., tax rules, discount policies, late checkout charges). Populate the
database with:
•3 hotel branches
•At least 10 rooms with different types
•6 services in the service catalogue
•5 guests with 8 total bookings
•Room availability records, service usage, and at least 3 partial payments
